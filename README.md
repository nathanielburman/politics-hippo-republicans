# politics-hippo-republicans

They will know us as dragons of the sea!

Hippos are going to own the water; creating waves, for a long time.

You canâ€™t chain down a hippo to the water.

I need Hippopotamus Republicans.

The dollar vote Republican economists. They can thrive in any system. They have an aquatic water style which is different from RHINO Republicans and the classic main stay Elephant Republicans.

The HIPPO Republicans are younger Republicans. Water also represents chaos and monsters of lore.

Let there be elephants E-republicans, hippopotamus H-republicans, giraffe G-republicans, and rhinos R-republicans on Earth!
